# Message Bus implementation using Typescript
A message Bus is a combination of a common data model, a common command set, and a messaging infrastructure to allow one (or more) applications or services to communicate messages to one or more other applications or services. Message buses are usually “fire and forget”. But it can also be 'durable subscriptions' to ensure the broadcast. 


# Start commands
1. npm install
